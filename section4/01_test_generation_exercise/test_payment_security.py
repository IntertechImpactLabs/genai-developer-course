Security-focused tests for PaymentProcessor class.

TODO: Use o4-mini or o3 to generate security-aware tests for this file.

Focus areas:
1. Input validation (ensure proper sanitization)
2. Rate limiting effectiveness
3. Authorization checks
4. Error handling (no sensitive data in errors)
5. Concurrent request handling

For each area:
- Create tests that verify security controls exist
- Test boundary conditions
- Check error handling

Estimated time: 10 minutes
Estimated API cost: ~$0.50
Manual equivalent: ~5 hours

Note: These tests help identify common patterns but don't replace professional security audits.
