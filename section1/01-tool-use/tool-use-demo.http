# Tool Use Demonstration - ChatGPT API
# This demo shows the difference between LLMs with and without tools
# Prerequisites: 
# - Install REST Client extension in VS Code
# - Set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable

@openai-key={{$dotenv OPENAI_API_KEY}}

### Part 1: ChatGPT WITHOUT Tools
# Ask about current weather - LLM can't access real data
# https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create
# https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/object
# https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/messages/object
POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {{openai-key}}

{
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user", 
      "content": "What's the current weather like in San Francisco? I need the temperature and conditions."
    }
  ],
  "max_tokens": 200
}

### 
### Expected Response: LLM will say it can't access real-time data
###

### Part 2: ChatGPT WITH Tool Definition
# Same question but with get_weather tool available
# https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling
POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {{openai-key}}

{
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What's the current weather like in San Francisco and Minneapolis? I need the temperature and conditions."
    }
  ],
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get current weather information for a specified city",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "city": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "The city name, e.g. San Francisco"
            },
            "units": {
              "type": "string",
              "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
              "description": "Temperature units"
            }
          },
          "required": ["city"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "tool_choice": "auto"
}

###
### Expected Response: LLM will make a tool_call requesting weather data
### Copy the tool call details for the next request
###

---

### Part 3: Simulate Tool Execution
# This simulates what an agent would do - execute the weather tool
# In a real agent, this would call the actual weather API
# For demo purposes, we'll use this mock response:

# Mock weather API response for San Francisco:
# {
#   "location": "San Francisco, CA", 
#   "temperature": 68,
#   "condition": "partly cloudy",
#   "humidity": 72,
#   "wind_speed": 12
# }

###
### This mock data represents what a real weather API would return
### In production, an agent would make the actual API call here
###

---

### Part 4: Send Tool Results Back to ChatGPT
# Complete the conversation by providing tool results
POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {{$dotenv OPENAI_API_KEY}}

{
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What's the current weather like in San Francisco? I need the temperature and conditions."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": null,
      "tool_calls": [
        {
          "id": "call_abc123",
          "type": "function",
          "function": {
            "name": "get_weather",
            "arguments": "{\"city\": \"San Francisco\", \"units\": \"fahrenheit\"}"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "tool",
      "tool_call_id": "call_abc123",
      "content": "{\"location\": \"San Francisco, CA\", \"temperature\": 68, \"condition\": \"partly cloudy\", \"humidity\": 72, \"wind_speed\": 12}"
    }
  ]
}

###
### Expected Response: LLM now provides a natural language response with mock weather data
###

### Part 5: Bonus - Multiple Tool Calls
# Show how LLM can call multiple tools in sequence
POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {{$dotenv OPENAI_API_KEY}}

{
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Compare the weather in San Francisco and New York City. Which city is warmer right now?"
    }
  ],
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get current weather information for a specified city",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "city": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "The city name"
            }
          },
          "required": ["city"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "tool_choice": "auto"
}

###
### This will likely result in two separate tool calls - one for each city
### Demonstrating how LLMs can plan multi-step tool usage
